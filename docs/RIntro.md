# R language Programming

## Introduction

* What is R
	* An interpreted languge for filtering, analyzing and visualizing data.
* What R is not
	* An automated analysis tool - you have to decide how to analyse the data
* Packages are an important feature of R
	* CRAN: package repository
	* Bioconductor: Bioinformatics oriented packages.
	
## R Studio
* R Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
* Why use R Studio?
	* Script, and other document Managment
	* Project Management (multiple scripts)
	* Help, Plots, History, Visualizations in one place
* Why Scripts
	* Saves a sequence of loading libraries and function calls to create an analysis or plot
	* Most Importantly: **Reproducible Research** - write scripts to reproducibly run your analysis
* Four sections:
	* Editor - write R code
	* History, Environment - see what you've done; your current variables and functions.
	* Files, Plots, Help
	* Console - interaction with R interpreter

## Let's get Started

* Download the class repository and uncompress it.
* Start RStudio
* Change the working directory to the class repository (*Session > Set Working Directory*)
* Create a Project (*File > New Project...  In An Existing Directory*)
* Call it 'RIntro' - or whatever you'd like.
